# Youtube-buttons and more!

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Kulsoom, an aspiring software developer in the world of tech. While I'm still learning the ropes, I wanted to dive in and create something that could be interactive and fun. This project is something I tried out a while ago when I was just starting out and wanted to begin with something small yet exciting!

I built these buttons as a way to practice HTML and CSS, and to challenge myself with a simple yet practical web design task. I find it incredibly rewarding to see how even small pieces of code can come together to create something functional!

## Project Description
This repository contains a simple HTML file with buttons that replicate YouTube's "Like" and "Subscribe" buttons. While the project is simple, it's been an amazing way to learn and understand the basics of web design. 

## Technologies Used
