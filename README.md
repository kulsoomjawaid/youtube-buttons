# Youtube-buttons and more!

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Kulsoom, an aspiring software developer in the world of tech. While I'm still learning the ropes, I wanted to dive in and create something that was interactive and fun. These projects are something I tried out a while ago when I was just starting out and wanted to begin with something small yet exciting!

I built these buttons and the amazon excersise as a way to learn HTML and CSS, and to challenge myself with a simple yet practical web design task. I find it incredibly rewarding to see how even small pieces of code can come together to create something functional!

## Project Description
This repository contains a simple HTML file with buttons that replicate YouTube's "Like" and "Subscribe" buttons additionally there is a link, and description on the amazon excersise. While the projects are simple, it's been an amazing way to learn and understand the basics of web design. 

## Technologies Used
